description: """
The package provides bindings for MPFR-4.1.0.

Warning: this bugfix2 version breaks backward compatibility since it renames the
Mpfr module into Mlmpfr. See thvnx#21 for more details.

You need to have MPFR-4.1.0 installed on your system. See opam info mlmpfr for
all available versions."""
